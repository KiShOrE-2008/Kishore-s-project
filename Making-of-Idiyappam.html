    <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <li><b>Roast the Rice Flour</b> (Optional but Recommended):</li>
            <ul>In a pan, lightly roast the rice flour on low heat for about 3–4 minutes until it becomes warm and slightly aromatic. This step helps in achieving softer idiyappam.</ul> </li>
        <li><b>Prepare the Dough:</b>
            <ol type="I">
                <li>In a mixing bowl, add the roasted rice flour and salt.</li>
                <li>In a separate saucepan, bring 1.25 to 1.3 cups of water to a boil.</li>
                <li>Gradually pour the hot water into the rice flour, stirring continuously to prevent lumps.</li>
                <li>Once the mixture starts to come together, cover the bowl and let it sit for 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>After resting, add oil or ghee and knead the mixture into a smooth, non-sticky dough.</li></ol>
        <li><b>Shape the Idiyappam:</b></li>
                <ol type="I">
                    <li>Grease the idiyappam press or sevai maker with oil or ghee.</li>
                    <li>Divide the dough into portions and fill the press.</li>
                    <li>Press the dough onto idli plates in concentric circles to form round discs</li>
                </ol>
        <li><b>Steam the Idiyappam:</b></li>
                <ol type="I">
                    <li>Steam the pressed idiyappam in an idli steamer or a regular steamer for 8–10 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Once done, remove the plates and let them cool slightly before serving.</li>
                </ol>
    </ol>
